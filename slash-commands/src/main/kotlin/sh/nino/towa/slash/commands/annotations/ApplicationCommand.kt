package sh.nino.towa.slash.commands.annotations

/**
 * Represents an application command that can be registered. This is the metadata
 * for a slash command, in simpler terms.
 *
 * @param name The name of the application command, 1-32 characters long. Use `AbstractApplicationCommand.localiseName(Locale, String)`
 * to append [`name_localizations`](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#create-global-application-command) with this command.
 *
 * @param description The description of the command, use `AbstractApplicationCommand.localiseDescription(Locale, String)` to
 * append [`descriptions_localizations`](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#create-global-application-command) with this command.
 *
 * @param defaultMemberPermissions A list of permissions that this command requires. When we register or update the commands,
 * this will be a long rather than array of longs.
 *
 * @param dmPermission Indicates whether the command is also available in DMs with the app, this is only used
 * for global-scoped commands.
 *
 * @param useInGuilds A list of guild IDs that this command should be registered in, by default, it is globally-scoped
 * if [SlashCommandsConfiguration.devServerId][sh.nino.towa.slash.commands.SlashCommandsConfiguration.devServerId] is populated,
 * it will append the `devServerId` and any other guilds appended by this array.
